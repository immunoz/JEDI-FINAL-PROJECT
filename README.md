# Jedi Final Project
This was the project I delievered at the end of the HTML5, CSS3 And Javascript Course from Jedi Academy.

## Some considerations to take into account
- API calls used to show the user information about a card may not work correctly due to updates in the API implementation (from time to time I will try to update it in order to solve this problem).
- When the web page is executed for the first time, the the twitter Item at the left side of the page may not load, just be patient, sometimes it takes a moment.
- Axios may do changes in the way API calls are done, in that case just check this [link](https://github.com/axios/axios#browser-support) and edit the buscador.js code.

## Built With
* [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) - Promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - Front-end open source toolkit
* [Embedded Twitter Timeline](https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/embed-twitter-feed) - Embed a collection of Tweets (known as a timeline) on your own website
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
